*This essay is based on a talk I gave at Web Directions Summit 23. It expands on many of the ideas I put forward in that talk, and provides further details.*

If content strategy is dead, this painting tells the story of its decay.

![A classical painting of the Tower of Babel story.](/assets/img/content-strategy-is-dead/bruegel-the-elder-tower-of-babel.png)

In 1563, Bruegel the Elder painted *The (Great) Tower of Babel.* It‘s story appears in a number of religious traditions (more on this below), and beautifully captures so many of the **challenges** and **problems** of content strategy. And, for that matter, of great products.

The story goes like this. 

Not long after the creation of the world, all the people on Earth came together and began to build a tower. They believed that if they built this tower tall enough — so tall it could reach the heavens — they would become gods. 

But of course, the *actual* God wasn’t a great fan of this plan. So he gave the people a gift — or perhaps a curse. This gift/curse was the gift of languages. 

From that moment, people from different tribes or nations began speaking in different tongues. They spoke to each other, but couldn’t understand each other. Once united, now people were divided by language and misunderstandings. 

And what happened to their mighty Tower, which was going to bring them untold knowledge, power and divinity? Of course, all work ceased. The people scattered, abandoning their project. And so ended the first and last time humanity would be truly united for a single, common goal.

Working on digital products — particularly in the content space, — means wrestling with the sorts of problems this story deals with, every day.

And I don’t just mean the experience of sitting in a room with a product manager, software engineer and product designer, trying to get them to agree on something. Talk about speaking different languages.

If content design is the hard work of creating products that work, then content strategy, at its the best, is the **practice of aligning organisations on how to do this.**

But so often we fail to genuinely engage with an organisation’s very real constraints and challenges. We exist to **help build great products, not deliver great content strategies.** 

![](/assets/img/content-strategy-is-dead/building-great-products.png)

And yet so often we are like these people trying to build a tower, while not speaking the language of everyone around us.

## The reality of (content) work

I run a multi-disciplinary consulting practice over at [Pragma Partners](http://www.pragma.com.au/); we work with with large private sector organisations, highly regulated industry and federal government clients. 

We help our clients design and build digital products, but we want to do this sustainably. This means building products that our clients can operate in the long term, without seeing significant product quality decay.

This can be challenging, because most organisations don’t have adequate content resourcing to sustain content quality over time. Our clients usually have one team with very deep expertise in content or human-centred design, but they usually aren’t operating at a scale to service the whole organisation. Or to service all of that organisation’s products (because there are usually *many)*.

But this isn’t just our clients.

**Research shows that resourcing content is not a priority for most companies.** 

A large(ish) survey conducted by [UX Content Collective](https://uxcontent.com/2023-content-design-salary-industry-survey/) this year found that most content folk are resourcing between 3–5 projects or product teams. 

That’s **one** content person in every **five** product teams. 

Of course, we have also seen a global decline in user research, user experience and content roles over the 2022–2023 period. While this is indeed the result of macroeconomic forces that we perhaps shouldn’t spend too much time navel-gazing or anxiety-spiralling about, there is of course the uncomfortably reality that it is these roles, not the engineers or the accountants or even the marketers, that were discretionary enough to layoff. For all of the opportunity in the industry over the last couple of years, it is clear that the human-centred design field still has much work to do.

And this is especially true in the content space. We — content designers, content strategists, content-leaning product thinkers — should be especially confronted by this.

Because, of course, it also means this:

![](/assets/img/content-strategy-is-dead/content-isnt-created-by-content-people.png)

To the extent that content on the web is created by people at *all* (no longer a given!), it is mostly **not** created by content people.

An yet, it is still created! No client of ours suffers from too *little* content. No, the diagnosis is almost always too *much* content. (I have written about this [before](https://medium.com/pragma-partners/just-in-case-content-is-killing-your-user-experience-e390a7a28317).)

Which tells us a few confronting things:

1 We are not necessary, and 
2 We are not working.

**1. Content specialists are not necessary**

As far as most of these organisations are concerned, their products are just *fine.* Or if their products aren’t fine, this is a problem that can be localised and solved in a redesign project, with a finite timeline and budget. 

Experience tells me that in decision-makers minds, there is usually no link between **ongoing product resourcing** and **product quality**.

And in the meantime, content continues to be created and operated by whoever can fit it in their job description.

Content creation doesn’t need to be done by content specialists. 

**2. Content strategy is not working**

The problem is that the people who are doing the content don’t know that it matters, or how to make it better. 

But content strategists see this problem, and try to solve it by making more content decisions. We make strategy documents, guidance, principles, standards, policies, processes, frameworks. 

We then foist them onto these poor content owners, who don’t know what to do with them, but — more importantly — don’t even know why they *should* *care.* 

We need a new approach. 

Over the last 12–24 months we’ve been working with clients to try a new way of achieving sustainable content quality over time. 

And we’re convinced that **no decision you make about content will be as powerful as spending time with the people who make the content.**

![](/assets/img/content-strategy-is-dead/building-content-culture.png)

## Influence, not decisions

We’ve been working with clients to reframe what we do when we do a content project. 

We’re viewing content projects as being *primarily* about building content culture rather than making content decisions. 

Because our content decisions weren’t working. Clients were *buying* content strategies but we couldn’t shake the feeling that they weren’t being *used.* We would end a project, and months later there was no perceivable difference to their product.

We asked ourselves, what would it take for this company to continue improving content quality, even after we’re no longer working with them?

We know we can come in, make a bunch of decisions, fix their products and then leave. But what would it mean if we didn’t do that, but instead worked with all the people working on content across the organisation, improve their capability? The product designers, service designers, product managers, engineers. But also the policy officers, the security experts, the technical staff, the scientists, the subject-matter experts. 

But how on earth do you change a whole organisation’s culture around content?

## There’s no shortcut for time

We knew this would be harder than what we had been doing. Most of the time we can turn around some robust discovery, research and strategy articulation in 8-12 weeks. But this is what we’d been doing in the content strategy space and it hadn’t been working. Some principles from the strategy might be applied by our immediate client team, but the impact on the broader org was minimal. 

If our job is to create great products, these content projects weren’t effective enough. 

So we flipped the model, and took **much longer** in working with clients on their content operations. We started working at length with content owners across the whole organisation, focussing on training and knowledge sharing, and changing behaviour and motivations around content. 

It wasn’t faster, or easier. But it does work. 

## Changing content behaviour

So how did we do this? 

![](/assets/img/content-strategy-is-dead/eiffel-tower.png)

To extend the tower building metaphors, we start with a wide base. 

We first run wide content discoveries across as much of the organisation as we can get our hands on. We then narrow our focus, running awareness-raising activities with content owners. We use these to identify candidates for our next level of engagement, which is highly targeted pair writing sessions that are focussed around behaviour change. 

This is all with one goal in mind: to turn **content stakeholders** into **content allies.** 

![](/assets/img/3-steps.png)

## Go wide in discovery
I won’t go into detail here about running discovery activities or projects. Suffice to say, we aim to meet with or talk to as many people in the organisation as possible - every person who touches content while it makes its merry way from creation to production.
I love a telescope as a metaphor for a discovery. Because discoveries can feel pretty broad and wide. And they need to be. But it’s easy to forget that you go wide, **so that** you know where to zoom in. You’re scanning wide so you can be informed about where you want to focus. And then you point your telescope. 
In our content discoveries, we’re meeting with everyone possible, so that we can find the hidden corners and dark spots where we might turnover something interesting. Who are the people who - with some training and support - can make a difference to content quality.
So I want to share some of the best, most insightful and *fastest* techniques we have to gauge content appetite and awareness.
### The GIF scale
This is an activity we use a lot when we’re in the early stages of working with a client, and we’re learning about the teams, stakeholders, power structures and influences within that organisation. This stage of a project is usually all about saturating our brains in names, roles, org charts and relationships, and this activity is one of the fastest ways of uncovering  lots of information about the appetite and emotional landscape of teams. 
You devise a scale of one to five and represent it in GIFs - here we have from “yikes” to “amazing” and we asked this team to tell us how they feel about the website.
![](image%204.png)
You’ll see it gives us a really great snapshot that tells us a lot about how this project it going to go. Just from this quick one-minute activity we can see:
- this team pulls no punches in their assessment of the product; we will be able to have frank conversations with them about what needs to be done
- they are pretty well aligned; only two outliers but otherwise a high convergence
- they are likely going to want us to push them along; they probably won’t be resistant to change
Let’s look at another example!

#### What’s so good about it?
- **It doubles as an ice breaker and a warm up** - it sets a great tone, gets people laughing and chatting, and breaks down barriers.
- **It’s packs a punch** - this activity takes 3-5 minutes and provides so much information about teams and organisations.
